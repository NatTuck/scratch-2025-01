Life tips:

 - Attend class
 - Eat healthy
 - Sleep not more than 10 hours a day, and not less than 7.75

Python:

 - Computer language is like a natural language in some ways.
   - Vocabulary
   - Syntax
   - Semantics

Vocabulary of Python:

 - Literals
   - int (decimal or hex): one or more decimal digits 
     (or for hex, after an 0x prefix)
   - float: one or more decimal digits, a dot, and then zero
     or more decimal digits
   - str: in "quotes" or 'quotes'
   - bool: is either True or False
 - Variable names
   - start with a letter (or underscore) and continue
     with zero or more letters, undscores, or numbers

Statements in Python:

 - Variable assignment
   - varname = "some value"
   - no value
   - Does something: assigns the value to the variable
 - Any expression
   - has a value
 - Function call without return value
 - Control flow:
   - if staments
   - while loops
   - for loops

Expressions (a piece of code with a value):

 - A literal
   - Doesn't do anything
   - Value: whatever is represented by that literal
 - Variable refernce
   - Doesn't do anything
   - Value: whatever's in the variable
 - Arithmetic on anything
   - ==           True if two things are equal
   - !=           True if two things are not equal
 - Arithmetic operation on numbers
   - 3 + 5        8
   - -, \*, /     as expected 
   - %            remainder, for positive inputs
                  called "modulus", always produces positive output
   - //           integer division
 - Arithmetic on strings
   - "one" + "two"        => "onetwo"
   - "one" * 3            => "oneoneone"
 - Arithmetic on booleans
   - 3 < 5                => True
   - 3 >=  12             => False
   - >, <=
   - and, or, not

 - Function calls
   - Are expressions if they return values
   - name of function followed by parens, function arguments
     go in the parens separated by commas
   - function arguments can be any expression
