New language: C

- An old language from the 70's.
- That's still basically fine.

Specific concepts:

- Pointers
  - And how they are related to arrays.

```C
int xs[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
int* ys = xs;

xs[2];
*(ys + 2)
```

File I/O:

- Standard C library IO: fopen, fread, fclose, etc.
- System calls: open, read, close, etc.

Process creation:

- fork, exec
- wait

Command line shell implementation:

- FD table
- Redirects, pipe

The C / Linux dev environment:

- Editor (vi)
- Compiler (gcc)
- Debugger (gdb)
- Document (man pages)
